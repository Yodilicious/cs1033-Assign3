            </ul>
            
            <h3>WHAT IS INCLUDED IN MY ORDER?</h3>
            
            <p class="default-text">Envelopes are included with invitations and cards.  Invitations and cards are blank and come ready to add your own printed card stock, ribbon and your special touches.  All products are unassembled.</p>
            
            <h3>WHAT IS THE MINIMUM ORDER?</h3>
            
            <p class="default-text">A minimum order is $25.00 excluding shipping and any other Incidental charges.  Please allow 7-10 days for delivery.</p>
            
            <h3>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?</h3>
            
            <p class="default-text">The easy answer is 7-10  Business* Days In-House Processing Time and any shipping transit time is in addition to this processing time.  We need to process your order and then day 3-5, we upload your order to a secure site for you to proof and confirm the order.  After you approve your Typeset Proof, your order takes 2-3 business days to print, inspect and pack for shipping. Your order usually prints and ships within 1-3 business days after receipt of your proof approval.  Please check your emailed invoice for your estimated ship date.</p>
            
            <h3>WHY DO I HAVE TO APPROVE A PROOF?</h3>
            
            <p class="default-text">Experience has taught us that getting an order right the first time, every time is critical and our easy on-line proof approval ensures everyone "gets it right" the first time.  On your FREE typeset proof, we:</p>
            
            <ul>
            	<li>Correct line spacing and layout for the best eye appeal</li>
                <li>Correct grammar, punctuation and misspelling of common words</li>
                <li>Allow you see the finished product BEFORE it prints which guarantees everyone is happy the first time, every time.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="default-text">When you go through our simple proof approval process, we know you will agree that the short wait for a professional typeset proof is worth the short amount of time it took to make sure your order is perfect!</p>
            
            <h3>CAN I GET RUSH SERVICE?</h3>
            
            <p class="default-text">Rush Service is an additional fee charged to receive your FREE typeset proof faster than our normal processing time.*  Once this fee has been charged, it is not refundable for any reason, including problems with your e-mail or shipping times.  We realize how time flies, and sometimes people get behind on ordering invitations and birth announcements. If you require your proof faster than our 3-57-10 day processing time, we have created a special RUSH service for an additional fee plus the cost of Next Day Air* shipping. The Rush Order option can be added to your order from the shopping cart.</p>
            
            <h3>CAN I CHANGE AN EXISTING ORDER?</h3>
            
            <p class="default-text">When you place an order, we diligently try to ensure that your order is completed quickly, efficiently, correctly and by our estimated time schedule.  Once your order has been submitted, all departments begin their respective jobs, including invoicing, pulling the stock for your order in the quantity that appears on your order form, typesetting, proof uploading, printing and shipping.</p>
            
            <p class="default-text">The only changes that can be made to an order once it has been submitted are:</p>
            
            <ol>
            	<li>Corrections or additions to the information that is contained on the custom printed portion of your order only DURING the typeset proof review and approval process.</li>
                <li>Upgrading your shipping method to 1st, 2nd or 3rd day air at an additional cost (Done during the proof approval process only).</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p class="default-text">Once an order has been placed, we cannot increase or decrease the quantity ordered and still ensure your order is processed correctly and in a timely manner.</p>
            
            <h3>CAN I DECREASE THE QUANTITY ON AN ORDER?</h3>
            
            <p class="default-text">Sorry, but orders cannot be decreased once they have been submitted, so please order wisely.  When you place an order, we try to ensure that your order is completed quickly, efficiently, correctly and on time.  Once you order has been submitted, all departments begin their respective jobs, including pulling the stock for your order in the quantity that appears on your order form.  Thank you for your understanding.</p>
            
            <h3>CAN I DO THE PRINTING MYSELF?</h3>
            
            <p class="default-text">The answer is YES and NO.  Not all of our designs are available as blank stock.</p>
            
            <p class="default-text">If "Blank Card" is not an option on the order screen for the paper design you have chosen, it is probably because it is one of our exclusive designs we do not sell blank, or it is just not easy to print and we have chosen not to frustrate you by allowing you to buy it blank.</p>
            
            <p class="default-text">We do not sell Vellum designs blank as the vellum paper does not work well in inkjet printers--the ink bleeds and is unreadable. Also, vellum jams like crazy in laser printers because it is so thin. So, to save us and our customers a lot of headaches, we do not sell vellum designs blank.</p>
            
            <p class="default-text">The papers we do offer blank should work in laser and/or ink jet printers, but as there are so many home printers available, we do not guarantee any blank paper will work with the system and/or printer you have.  Because we cannot resell paper that has bent edges or other defects (would you want us to resell returned paper to you?), there is NO refund or return of blank cards for any reason, so please be sure you really want to do the printing before you order blank cards. We have very generic printing instructions if you are having trouble printing them yourself. Click here for instructions.</p>
            
            <p class="default-text">We have found that in most cases, you will save money by buying printed announcements or invitations. If we do the printing, we will save you time, as we do this all day long, we save you a lot of frustration in figuring out how to print, and if we goof up (which happens occasionally), we absorb the cost of replacing the paper to fill your order--If you goof, you have to buy more paper.</p>
            
            <h3>WHAT ARE YOUR PAYMENT OPTIONS?</h3>
            
            <p class="default-text">We know it takes time to place an order, so once you have clicked the "Submit Order" button, you want your order to be completed as soon as possible.  Once submitted, our work begins:  Your order is received, invoiced, typeset, and stock is pulled from our warehouse to fill your order.  So, for us to begin our work and complete your order ASAP, payment in full is made automatically to your credit card when you click the "Submit Order" button. We accept MasterCard, Visa and American Express through our secure site.  (Your credit card is charged when you click submit, so please don't click it more than once as each click charges your order again in full.)  If you find it necessary to cancel an order after it has been submitted, please read our Cancellation Policy as some fees agreed to during the ordering process will apply.</p>
            
            <h3>WHAT IS YOUR RETURN POLICY?</h3>
            
            <p class="default-text">There are no refunds or returns of any custom printed items due to their personalized nature.  NO exceptions. Please refer to Cancellation section above for fees incurred if an order has been canceled after it has been submitted, but before it has been processed.</p>
            
            <p class="default-text">There are NO refunds or returns of any blank stock or party favors at any time.  Blank stock orders and party favor orders are processed as soon as they are received and in some instances, shipped within minutes of processing your order. Blank orders or party favors may also be drop shipped from our suppliers directly to you. We do not allow returns of blank stock or party favors for one very good reason - Do you want to buy returned, previously handled and "shipped all over the place" items? We don't so we don't try to resell them to you, our customers, either.</p>
            
            <p class="default-text">Once a shipment has left our office, we have no control over what happens to it. We cannot take back items that have bent corners, fingerprints and other possible damage and try to resell them.  I'm sure you, as our customer, would not appreciate receiving less than perfect invitations or products from us, so we will never try to sell them to you. We are well aware that other companies take back everything, but the hidden costs and customer disappointment in receiving less than perfect goods raises prices for everyone.</p>
            
            <p class="default-text">If you have any questions on blank stock orders, party favor orders, paper characteristics, colors, etc., please call us at 800-444-2269 or email us your question before placing your order.</p>
